This folder contains data generated from the defined-peptide libraries for testing peptide optimizations and the processing pipeline.

Peptide lists for the original selection ('replicate 1') and a replicate selection ('replicate 2') contain read counts for each allele and round (e.g. count_R0-401 for Round 0, HLA-DR401).

Processing files include a Bash file for assembling paired-end reads via PANDAseq (Masella et al, BMC Bioinformatics 2012) and Jupyter Notebook for extracting and filtering peptide sequences.
