DR401_validation_results.csv and DR402_validation_results.csv contain the sequences observed in the each validation experiment, their read counts in individual rounds, and the RSR value assigned to them.

Validation_Results_Organized.csv organizes the results from both experiments by the type of sequence, which were then used for figure production and further analysis.
