The notebook Compute_RSR.ipynb contains the code used to generate RSR values for sequences given read counts

The function in Compute_RSR_NullModel.ipynb contains an additional null model parameter that takes in a baseline model where each read count is sampled independently from a fixed set of round dependent distributions.
