Run RUN_PUFFIN.py to get model predictions. The script takes a single argument, which is the .pep file to input. The .pep file is a list of 9mers separated by line. See TEST.pep for an example. The script prints two dataframes. The first dataframe contains the predictions for DR401 affinity and the second dataframe contains the predictions for DR402 affinity.
